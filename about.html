			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<div class="container">
			
			<p class='p-hi'>Hi! Iâ€™m Sarah, and I'm a 3rd year computer science major at UC Berkeley! Go Bears! 
				<br>
				Random Facts:
				<br>
					<ul>Born in the US, from and raised in Taipei, Taiwan - 3rd culture kid woohoo!</ul>
					<ul>I love honey mustard but I loathe yellow mustard</ul>
					<ul>Aside from Taipei, my favorite city is New York--SF is a close second</ul>
				<br>
				I was born in Monterey Park but raised in Taipei, Taiwan (land of bubble tea, cheap street food, and amazing desserts)! I absolutely love having meaningful conversations with people, cute babies (humans and animals alike), chocolates, Friends, Harry Potter, playing the piano and violin from time to time, vacuuming, surprises, New York, and reading.
